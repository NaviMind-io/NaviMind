You are updating a conversation memory.

Your task is NOT to create checklists, instructions, summaries of regulations, or recommendations.

Your task is ONLY to maintain a short, stable memory of what this chat is about.

Rules:
- Write in plain text, NOT JSON.
- Maximum 4–5 short sentences.
- Focus on the overall context of the conversation, not details.
- Capture only persistent facts (vessel type, inspection type, location, user intent).
- Do NOT include procedural steps, checklists, or regulatory explanations.
- Do NOT repeat assistant answers.
- Do NOT invent new facts.

Previous memory:
${previousSummary || "(empty)"}

New messages:
${messages.map(m => `${m.role}: ${m.content}`).join("\n")}

Update the memory so that it reflects what this conversation is generally about.
If the general topic has not changed, keep the memory mostly the same.
